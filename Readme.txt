Hereâ€™s a detailed summary of the steps to set up the environment and run the `fraud_detection.py` application using XGBoost on a Windows machine. You can document these steps in your GitHub README file for new users.

### **Steps to Set Up and Run the XGBoost Fraud Detection Application**

#### **1. Install Python**
- Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website:  
  [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- During installation, make sure to select the option **"Add Python to PATH"**.

#### **2. Set Up a Virtual Environment**
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies.

1. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** and navigate to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd G:\MachineLearning\XGBoostApp
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv my_env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   .\my_env\Scripts\activate  # For PowerShell
   ```

4. Your command prompt will change to indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g., `(my_env)` will appear).

#### **3. Install Required Libraries**
With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file in the project folder with the following content:
   ```
   xgboost
   pandas
   scikit-learn
   openpyxl
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### **4. Download the Sample Dataset**
- Download the fraud detection dataset from the link provided and save it in your project folder (e.g., `fraud_detection_data.xlsx`).

   [Download fraud_detection_data.xlsx](sandbox:/mnt/data/fraud_detection_data.xlsx)

#### **5. Create the Python Script**
1. Create a new Python file in your project folder named `fraud_detection.py`.
2. Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_excel("G:/MachineLearning/XGBoostApp/fraud_detection_data.xlsx")

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print("Dataset preview:")
print(data.head())

# Separate features and target variable
X = data.drop(["TransactionID", "IsFraud"], axis=1)  # Features
y = data["IsFraud"]  # Target variable

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the XGBoost classifier
model = XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric="logloss", random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"\nAccuracy: {accuracy:.2f}\n")
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Predict fraud for a new transaction (example)
new_transaction = pd.DataFrame({
    "Amount": [250.75],
    "Location": [3],
    "TransactionType": [1],
    "TimeOfDay": [14]
})

predicted_class = model.predict(new_transaction)[0]
print(f"\nPredicted class for new transaction: {predicted_class} ({'Fraud' if predicted_class == 1 else 'Not Fraud'})")
```

3. Ensure that the path to the dataset file (`fraud_detection_data.xlsx`) is correct in the script.

#### **6. Run the Application**
1. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** in the project folder.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python fraud_detection.py
   ```

3. The output will display:
   - A preview of the dataset.
   - The model's accuracy and performance metrics.
   - The fraud prediction for a new sample transaction.

#### **7. Modify or Enhance the Model**
- **Class Imbalance**: If you notice that the model does not perform well on fraud predictions (as observed in the classification report), consider implementing techniques like:
  - **Resampling**: Oversampling the fraud cases or undersampling non-fraud cases.
  - **Class Weights**: Assigning higher weights to fraud cases when training the model.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: You can improve the model's performance by adjusting hyperparameters like `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, and `n_estimators`.
